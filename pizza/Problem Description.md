The challenge
-
You are at a party, your guests are getting hungry and you, as a good host, would like to order some pizza for them. The problem is that you don't know how many slices each person eats, neither how many large, medium or small pizzas to order.
So you go and ask around your guests to find out who eats 1 slice of pizza, 2 slices of pizza, 3 slices of pizza or 4 slices of pizza. For the sake of this problem, your guests don't eat more than 4 slices of pizza...

These are the sizes of the pizzas
- Large - 8 slices
- Medium - 6 slices
- Small - 4 slices

After you gather all the data, you enter it into your program and it magically gives you the right answer.

Input
-
You will ask the following:

**"How many guests eat only 1 slice of pizza:"**

**"How many guests eat 2 slices of pizza:"**

**"How many guests eat 3 slices of pizza:"**

**"How many guests eat 4 slices of pizza:"**

Output
-
After you entered how many of your guests eat 4 slices of pizza, your program will automatically calculate how many small, medium and large pizzas you will need to satisfy your guests in this format:

**"Large Pizzas: X"**

**"Medium Pizzas: Y"**

**"Small Pizzas: Z"**
